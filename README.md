# Communis-site

I'm no expert at design this is mostly for someone else to build upon. It's mostly a base of ideas.

A site for the fellow commies. Only the design has been worked on. No data fetching or blockchain interaction. Since we're comrades I have done my part so now someone else has to take on the torch! This site is not even close to done but maybe it can get someone else off the ground. It's very responsive and has a nice style to it 


The packages should come with the repo so you just need to clone it.

You only need to install svelte (And Node package manager obviously)

And in case it doesn't work to just clone the repo you can download SPA-router manually which is the only 3rd party package (By design).
